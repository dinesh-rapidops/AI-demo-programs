## Python Exercise
* [Exercise1](python-exercise/exercise1.py): Create a program that asks the user to enter their name and their age. Print out a message addressed to them that tells them the year that they will turn 100 years old.
* [Exercise2](python-exercise/exercise2.py): Ask the user for a number. Depending on whether the number is even or odd, print out an appropriate message to the user. 
* [Exercise3](python-exercise/exercise3.py): Take a list, say for example this one:
  a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
and write a program that prints out all the elements of the list that are less than 5.
* [Exercise4](python-exercise/exercise4.py): Create a program that asks the user for a number and then prints out a list of all the divisors of that number. (If you don’t know what a divisor is, it is a number that divides evenly into another number. For example, 13 is a divisor of 26 because 26 / 13 has no remainder.)
* [Exercise5](python-exercise/exercise5.py): Take two lists, say for example these two:
  a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
  b = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]
and write a program that returns a list that contains only the elements that are common between the lists (without duplicates). Make sure your program works on two lists of different sizes.
* [Exercise6](python-exercise/exercise6.py): Ask the user for a string and print out whether this string is a palindrome or not. (A palindrome is a string that reads the same forwards and backwards.)
* [Exercise7](python-exercise/exercise7.py): Let’s say I give you a list saved in a variable: a = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]. Write one line of Python that takes this list a and makes a new list that has only the even elements of this list in it.
* [Exercise8](python-exercise/exercise8.py): Write a program that takes a list of numbers (for example, a = [5, 10, 15, 20, 25]) and makes a new list of only the first and last elements of the given list. For practice, write this code inside a function.
* [Exercise9](python-exercise/exercise9.py): Write a program (function!) that takes a list and returns a new list that contains all the elements of the first list minus all the duplicates.
* [Exercise10](python-exercise/exercise10.py): Write a function that takes an ordered list of numbers (a list where the elements are in order from smallest to largest) and another number. The function decides whether or not the given number is inside the list and returns (then prints) an appropriate boolean.
